### Workflow

Check an email and its metadata for evidences of phishing attack:  

- **Impersonalisation attempts**: sender is trying to identify himself as somebody he is not  
- **Suspicious askings or offers**: download "invoice", click on link with something important etc  
- **Psychological manipulations**: invoking a sense of urgency or fear is a common phishing tactic  
- **Spelling mistakes**: legitimate messages usually don't have spelling mistakes or poor grammar
